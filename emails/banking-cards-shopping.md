# ðŸ’³ Banking cards / shopping

A simple question â€“ how many websites know your banking card's data?

Did you set up purchase limits?

I believe that a lot of people have only one card for online and offline shopping and it's a real problem, the motivation is similar to [passwords.md](../passwords.md "mention") leaks: it's enough to only one data leak from one online store, and all your money could be stolen

How to protect your shopping:

1. For each store create a new virtual banking card â€“ when a data leak happens and your money will be stolen you will know who is to blame, at least
2. Set up spending limits; for example, you know that you spend around $200 via amazon, so you have to allow spending from the virtual card (for amazon) a maximum of $200 per month, this will protect you from unnecessary losses
3. Turn on 3DS even for small purchases
4. These simple rules protect your offline purchase too â€“ just set up limits, use [apple pay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) or [google pay](https://pay.google.com/about/) when it's possible
5. If you have a lot of physical cards and you store them in one wallet (or purse) â€“ add a piece of paper with 5 <mark style="color:red;">**fake**</mark> pin codes from these cards; when somebody will try to use them via ATM or for offline payment â€“ your cards will block
6. And remember â€“ sometimes it's enough just a card's number to pay something, so please â€“ do not share them

And about sharing, how it's possible?

* You entered cards data on a phishing resource or in a vulnerable online store
* You lost your physical card
* You give your card to a salesperson or a waitress and they take a photo of the card; In usual case, they will sell them via the darknet in 1/2 months and you already forgot who have access to this one
