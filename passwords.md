# üóù Passwords

**Motivation**

The human memory is not ideal storage device ‚Äì it's not possible to remember 100 passwords

Especially for raraly usable resources (do you remember your password for Skype/ICQ/first bank account?)

Just imagine ‚Äì somebody hacked a delivery service and received your login/password... And this pair you use for many other services, so ‚Äì the hacker received an access to all your accounts just via a one data breach; Password manager generates a unique password for each your internet account

**How to**

1. Just select the best password manager for you
   * for most cases [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is good
   * Or you may compare them and select something more suitable for your - https://www.passwordmanager.com/
   * If you do not trust online solutions - use a one of offline KeePass (just google)
2. After selecting a password manager
   *   You have to create a reliable password

       This password will be used to decrypt all your data (in common case servers do not know your passwords, they store only encrypted data; client side decrypts your passwords, even in offline)
   * Server side will provide to you additional secret ‚Äì backup it everywhere physically, at least 3 times (not in email, pls)
   * Review all security settings of selected solution

Just remember: when you will forget you main password (or server secret) ‚Äì you will lost all your data, nobody will help you

So.. you must really remember your main password!

**Password requirements**&#x20;

1. It has to be a really new password, just check your choice here [Have I Been Pwned: Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)
2. If you have your favorite password and just wanna add to it more security by capitalizing a first letter, or adding number `1` or exclamation mark `!` to the end of the password ‚Äì it is not good decision, just read this article [Password policies of most top websites fail to follow best practices (princeton.edu)](https://passwordpolicies.cs.princeton.edu/)
3. Goof choise - generate a memorable password by this tool [Create a strong, secure, & random password | Password Generator | 1Password](https://1password.com/password-generator/) (it's the easies way, just believe me)
4. Or use a second line of your favorive poetry (For example: `My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun`)

Some experience

Your secret may be a simple word (or not) and all your accouns will be protected by a real uniq password

It is not so comfortable, like applications, but your secrets are protected like your own physical property (not very good)

And what to do in case data breach?

**Passwordless login manager** ([heylogin](https://www.heylogin.com/en))

Replaces all login forms by a simple login button

Uses encryption module of mobile phone (because you are using biometry authentication for access to it)

Works good in case, when login and password are on the form together, and provides the easies way for setup 2FA
