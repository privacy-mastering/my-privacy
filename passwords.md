# üóù Passwords

**Motivation**

The human memory is not an ideal storage device ‚Äì it's not possible to remember 100 passwords

Especially for rare usable resources (do you remember your password for Skype/ICQ/first bank account?)

Just imagine ‚Äì somebody hacked a delivery service and received your login/password... And this pair you used for many other services, so ‚Äì the hacker received access to all your accounts just via one data breach; Meanwhile, a  password manager generates a unique password for each of your internet accounts

**How to**

1. Just select the best password manager for you
   * In most cases [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is good
   * Or you may compare them and select something more suitable for your - https://www.passwordmanager.com/
   * If you do not trust online solutions - use one of the offline KeePass (just google)
2. After selecting a password manager
   *   You have to create a reliable password

       This password will be used to decrypt all your data (in common cases servers do not know your passwords, they store only encrypted data; client-side decrypts your passwords, even offline)
   * The server side will provide you an additional secret ‚Äì backup it everywhere physically, at least 3 times (not in email, pls)
   * Review all security settings of the selected solution

Just remember: when you will forget your main password (or server secret) ‚Äì you will lose all your data, and nobody will help you

So.. you must really remember your main password!

**Password Requirements**&#x20;

1. It has to be a really new password, just check your choice here [Have I Been Pwned: Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)
2. If you have your favorite password and just wanna add to it more security by capitalizing the first letter or adding the number `1` or exclamation mark `!` to the end of the password ‚Äì it is not a good decision, just read this article [Password policies of most top websites fail to follow best practices (princeton.edu)](https://passwordpolicies.cs.princeton.edu/)
3. Good choice ‚Äì generate a memorable password with this tool [Create a strong, secure, & random password | Password Generator | 1Password](https://1password.com/password-generator/) (it's the easiest way, just believe me)
4. Or use the second line of your favorite poetry (For example: `My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun`)

#### Qwertycards

[Qwertycards - for easy to remember very strong passwords](https://www.qwertycards.com/) - interesting concept for paranoic

Your secret may be a simple word (or not) and all your accounts will be protected by a real unique password

It is not so comfortable, like applications, but your secrets are protected like your own physical property (not very good)

And what to do in a case of a data breach? How to change a password quickly?&#x20;

#### **Passwordless login manager** ([heylogin](https://www.heylogin.com/en))

Replaces all login forms with a simple login button

Uses the encryption module of mobile phone (because you are using biometry authentication for access to it)

Works well in case, when login and password are on the form together, and provides the easiest way to setup 2FA

I may recommend It to all who do not want to think about passwords as a something special&#x20;

#### [Bitwarden Open Source Password Manager | Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)

It's a fully opensource solution with free access, but some useful features are on paid accounts

With a lot of useful integrations

Just select a preferred pricing plan [https://bitwarden.com/pricing/ ](https://bitwarden.com/pricing/)

#### [Password Manager for Families, Businesses, Teams | 1Password](https://1password.com/)

It's not an open source but is a very good choice for families and businesses with rich functionality for business

Also, check all your accounts for data leaks

There is no free plan

But I checked a lot of password managers (for many years) and my choice - 1pass
