# ðŸ“§ Emails sharing

Do you receive a lot of spam emails?

Now you know â€“ you used your email address on a website that has been scanned or hacked

And do you know what website shared your email address? No? Because you used one email address for all your registrations!

What you have to do â€“ use a unique email address for each of your registration, even if it's offline sharing (for example dentist requests data from you to send appointment notifications)

**Why it is important?**

Because if you use the same password for your email service (Gmail) and hacked website â€“ they may hack your email

Just imagine what depends on your one email address: social networks, finance services (banks, exchanges), governmental services, and maybe secret documents in your mailbox...&#x20;

As well they may use your email address for target phishing, or send emails from your name to your friends

Again: it is important to hide your email address from public

#### Duckduckgo

The easiest way â€“ to use the free service [https://duckduckgo.com/email/](https://duckduckgo.com/email/)

Duckduckgo is a search engine that provides maximum privacy

As well it developed an email-relay service and comfortable browsers extension to generate a new email address for each new registration via any website, see examples below&#x20;

And seriously - now it's your unique address for the selected website, and if you receive spam to this one â€“ you know who shared it

Ok, how the forwarded email looks:

Note: there we see an actual service's email, original content and the "More" link, which will say what tracking links were removed from the email content

And more â€“ Deactivate button, to delete this email

There are no reasons not to trust Duckduckgo, but it's a free service

For use via mobile devices â€“ you have to setup a mobile browser and open it each time [https://duckduckgo.com/app](https://duckduckgo.com/app)
